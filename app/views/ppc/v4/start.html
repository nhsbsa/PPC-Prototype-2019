          Save money on NHS prescriptions by prepaying for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can pay a set price for prescriptions for 3 or 12 months, no matter how many you need.
        </p>
        <p>A prescription costs £9 per item, but prepaying for an unlimited number of prescriptions is:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>£29.10 for 3 months</li>
          <li>£104 for 12 months (or 10 Direct Debit instalments of £10.40)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We can send your certificate details by email, or you can print them at the end of the service.

          <!-- </details> This will include:
        </p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>a prepayment number</li>
          <li>a start date</li>
          <li>an end date</li>
        </ul> -->

          <p>
            Show your certificate details when you collect your prescription. You can collect prescriptions straight
            away, if your start date is today or earlier.
          </p>

          <!-- <h3 class="heading-medium">Collecting prescriptions</h3>

        <p>
          Tick box 'F' on the back of your prescription.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pharmacy staff ask for prepayment details. If you do not have them with you, they tick 'Evidence not seen' on the prescription. They will not charge you.
        </p>

        <p>
           We prevent fraud by matching prepayment details on our database with prescriptions.
        </p>
